# connect-four
a basic connect four ruby game, complete with score-checking and color.

### description

modeled off the classic game, this ruby exercise demonstrates object creation, nested functions, and instance methods, as well as basic data-structure perception.

### setup

be sure to have the bundle gem installed. clone the repo and navigate to the main directory and run `bundle install`. Once that's all done, run `ruby lib/play.rb`.
